        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>India’s official ‘pink city’, there’s much more to Rajasthan’s capital than its pink-red-tinged buildings and historic splendour. This majestic home to erstwhile royals is complete with old-world charm surrounded by colorful markets and chaotic streets. A part of the ‘Golden Triangle, Jaipur is a must-visit destination along with Agra and New Delhi. <br> <br>
         About 6 hours away from New Delhi, grand palaces and haveli is surrounded by mighty fortresses make Jaipur a welcome respite from high-rise malls and urban living. Blue pottery and more, take time off to watch a potter at work. Look out for the odd camel strolling through Jaipur’s busy streets as you make your way past hawkers and cycle rickshaws against a backdrop of its vibrant terracotta edifices. Stopover for the cultural show at Chowki Dhani before you head on to the world’s largest sundial at Jantar Mantar, Amer Fort, and the Palace of Winds, Hawa Mahal, overlooking Johari Bazaar. If you’re lucky enough to be untravelling Jaipur during Holi (in March), watch spectacularly bedecked elephants in action at elephant-polo. Then again, October in Jaipur has its own share of fun with the donkey festival and ‘best-looking donkey’ award as well as donkey racing and trading.</p>

        <p>From state-of-the-art museums to an utterly beguiling pink palace, Jaipur hosts a whole trove of treasures with which to dazzle visitors. Our day-by-day Jaipur itineraries will introduce you to all the city’s iconic wonders, as well as find spaces where you can just breathe and take it all in! If you are wondering how many days to spend in Jaipur, then I suggest that 3 is plenty. <br> <br>
        There are various methods of getting around Jaipur. Uber and Ola, another app-based cab service, both operate in Jaipur and are the most hassle-free ways of getting around. <br> <br>
        You can also take a rickshaw which is best for short distances. Try The Pink City Rickshaw Company which is run and owned by women from low-income households in Jaipur. It’s easy to spot these hot pink, eco-friendly, and custom-designed vehicles from a distance!</p>
