        <h1>How to Get Agra</h1>
        <p>Being one of the top bucket list destinations in India, Agra is well-connected to other Indian cities by an extensive rail and road network. There is also a domestic airport in Agra, but it is usually more convenient to fly to New Delhi or Jaipur due to more frequent flight options. <br />From those cities, you can take a taxi to Agra or hop on a train. Agra has several train stations, out of which Agra Cantonment (Agra Cantt) and Agra Fort are closer to the city centre. The Gatimaan Express from Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station in New Delhi only takes 1 hour and 40 minutes to reach Agra Cantonment. You can find more information about trains to Agra here.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you can also take your own car or book a private taxi and reach Agra at your convenience. The roads connecting Agra with both New Delhi and Jaipur are in good condition and the drive is pretty smooth and easy. Depending on how early you leave and the route taken, you can get from Jaipur to Agra in approximately four to six hours. <br /> <br />
        My friend and I booked a taxi from Savaari car rentals for this trip. They are an online cab aggregator in India that provides affordable chauffeur driven taxis in various cities across the country. Their expertise regarding road trips in India is really valuable, especially when going to off-beat places. I used their service to go from Kolkata to Odisha as well and loved that their quoted price includes tolls, state tax and GST so there are no surprises in the end. Check prices for their Jaipur to Agra cab here. <br /><br />
         Although trains to Agra take less time to reach, it may make sense for you economically to book a taxi when travelling in a group. But if on a tighter budget, there are also frequent buses that go to Agra daily. You can check the timing and prices for buses to Agra on redBus.</p>
