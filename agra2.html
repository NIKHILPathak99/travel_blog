                Construction started: 1631 <br>

             <p>Details on how to go, how to take beautiful photos and important information when visiting, I will dedicate another article to have more information for you refer to. <br> <br>
             If you don’t have much time for the Taj Mahal, you can buy a day tour from your hotel in New Delhi. There will be a shuttle service to pick up and drop you off at the place. If you are familiar with train travel in India, you can also buy a express train ticket to go back and forth in the same day, although it is a bit difficult. <br> <br>
             The Taj Mahal is very crowded, or in other words, extremely crowded from the very early morning, most of which, I think 80-90%, are Indian tourists. So queuing to buy tickets is also very difficult. <br> <br>
             Each ticket is only allowed to visit in the Taj Mahal for exactly 3 hours, if you return late, you have to pay an extra fee. Day tickets are not allow to access at night. On the ticket, there are very specific requirements, please remember to read carefully.</p>

            <h1>Agra Fort</h1>
            <p class="p1">Address: Agra Fort, Rakabganj, Agra, Uttar Pradesh 282003, India</p>
            <p>Agra Fort is also known as Lal Qila, Fort Rouge or Red Fort. Agra Fort is the second most important destination after the Taj Mahal. Agra Fort is located in the northwest of Agra city, 2.5 km northwest of Taj Mahah. So, standing here you can see the Taj Mahal in the distance.</p>

            <p>Originally Agra Fort was a brick fortress built by a family of Rajputs. However, the fort was later occupied by the Mughal dynasties and later rebuilt by the emperor Akbar. The inside of the fortress also includes mosques, halls, palaces, towers, and beautiful courtyards.</p>

            <h1>Itimad-Ud-Daulah</h1>
            <p class="p1">Address: Moti Bagh, Agra, Uttar Pradesh 282006, India <br> <br>
                Hours: 8AM–12AM</p>
            <p>This mausoleum is located across the Yamuna River, also known as Baby Taj for short. The main structure of ​​the mausoleum is built of white marble and is famous for its elaborate and sophisticated carvings. Many people consider it to be a small version of the Taj Mahal because of its very similar architecture.</p>

            <p>This mausoleum was built in honor of Mirza Ghiyas Beg, a bankrupt merchant who got lucky after his wife gave birth to their daughter Nur Jahan. <br> <br>
             Thereafter, Ghiyas Beg became the great treasurer under the Mughal Emperor Jahangir and was conferred the title Itmad-ud-Daulah (The “pillar of the State”) while his daughter was married to the emperor. <br> <br>
             His daughter, Nur Jahan, built this mausoleum for her father in the 1620s and his granddaughter, Mumtaz Mahal, was also built the Taj Mahal by her husband, the emperor Shah Jahan.</p>
